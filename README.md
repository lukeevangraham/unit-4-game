# Crystals Collector

## Overview
Deployed at: https://lukeevangraham.github.io/unit-4-game/

In this assignment, I created another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, the app dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library.

## Using the app

Briefly: click on the four crystals to add up to a randomly generated target number.

The app displays four crystals as buttons on the page.
The player is shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, the game adds a specific and mysterious amount of points to the player's total score. 

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player sees a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) resets to zero.


The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses.
